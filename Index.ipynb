    "### About multicloud-data-proximate computing\n",
    "\n",
    "The remote sensing cloud landscape is complex. Many data providers offer many different services based on different catalogues of Earth observation (EO) data. This repository introduces an approach - developed by EUMETSAT, ECMWF and the UK Met Office - that enables the exploitation of multiple EO collections across multiple cloud systems using a data-proximate computing strategy to distrubute cluster resources such that they remain as near to the data as possible. While this approach is developed primarily with our cloud resources in mind (e.g. The Copernicus WEkEO DIAS and European Weather Cloud) it is largely platform agnostic and can be configured to support any cloud resources (e.g. AWS - as has been done in the following linked example). For more information on the technical basis of the system, and examples of its deployment, please see this <a href=\"https://blog.dask.org/2022/07/19/dask-multi-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">**blog post**</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of these resources should be aware that the data proximate computing system is currently in the **prototype stage** and that any supporting marine and atmospheric composition data collections that are exploited in tutorials on its use are provided as **demonstration products only**. \n",

    "The **multicloud** module consists of a collection of Python-based Jupyter notebooks designed to demonstrate capabilities in processing large-scale marine and atmopsheric composition data from EUMETSAT using data proximate computing approaches across mutiple cloud platforms.
